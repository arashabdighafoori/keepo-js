## Features

- Manage secrets easily
- Keep secrets encrypted and available only with keys
- List required values

<br />

## Installation

```
npm install -g keepo-cli
```

<br />

## Usage

If you have a .keep file in the repo and you know the encryption key use `keepo init <your-encryption-key>` to initalize the directory. ( run the command in the directory with .keep file ).

To keep a value use `keepo set <key> <value>`
or use `keepo open` and edit the file in json format then save it.

To see the value of a given key, you can both use `keepo open` and then discard the file or `keepo get <key>`.
